#  Data Structures & Algorithms in C++
A well-structured open-source repository containing
Data Structures and Algorithms problems solved in **C++**
with **clear explanations and optimized approaches**.

 Contribution Guidelines
- Follow the folder structure
- Use the per-question README template
- Write clean and readable C++ code
- Mention time and space complexity

---

## 📁 Repository Structure
Each problem is stored in its own folder:

question/
├── README.md // should conatin a well structured explanation
└── solution.cpp // contains only main question , constraints and code

---

Per-Question README.md (Inside question/ folder)
# Problem: <Problem Name>
---
##  Problem Statement
<Write the problem clearly. Include constraints if available.>
---
##  Intuition
<Explain the first idea that comes to mind when seeing the problem.  
What pattern or concept does it resemble?>
---
##  Brute Force Approach
### Explanation
<Explain the brute force logic in simple terms.>
### Algorithm
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3
### Complexity
- Time: O(?)
- Space: O(?)
---
##  Optimization Reasoning
<Why is brute force inefficient?  
What do we need to optimize — time or space?>
---
##  Key Observation
<List the crucial insight(s) that lead to an optimized solution.>
---
##  Optimized Approach
